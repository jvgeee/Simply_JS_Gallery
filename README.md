Simply_JS_Gallery
=================

Just a very simple image gallery written in Javascript. I'm learning, and wanted to see if I could successfully write something without relying on jQuery to do the hard work for me

THE FEATURES:

11/12/12 - Can call for one/multiple/no elements (originally the function just ran automatically)
